Embedded Moments allow players can visit TapTap's Community inside the game and join other players, officials and gamers.

## I. How it works

### 1\. Set up the portal of Embedded Moments

Tips

- The little red dot is crucial to boost views. It is recommended to place the portal in a prominent position.
- The player will be notified when his/her followed user posts any new content. Notifications are refreshed every minute.  For every new message, the player will be reminded with a small red dot on the user interface.
- The red dot need to be cleared after the player have opened Moments.

### 2\. Content in the Moments

Players can find the following information in Moments.

- **Followed**: For the player who has logged in to TapTap, it defaults to displaying **the Moments posted by users that the player follows on TapTap **and **the official Moments**.
- **All**: For the player who has not logged in to TapTap, it defaults to display Moments of the game. When the player engages with the Moment, it reminds the player to log in.
- **Others**: Consistent with TapTap Community.

### 3\. Publish Moments

- In Embedded Moments, players can publish **Moments** and **videos**.

### 5\. Turn off Moments

The game can remind the player to turn off the Moments in certain scenarios. For example, the game can remind the player right before the player is ready to start the battle.

### 7\. Set up a theme

To support the game’s content operation, and to match the interface with the style of game, Embedded Moments supports customizing the theme of the interface. Operation staff of the game can go to Embedded Moments settings in the Developer Center and customize the theme skin, box color scheme and background images, etc.  The image needs to be reviewed and it usually will be completed in 2 business days.

Operation staff of the game can view the data of Embedded Moments in the Group Management Center.

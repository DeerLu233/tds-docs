You can view the credentials of your app by going to **Developer Center > Your game > Game Services > Configuration**:

- **Client ID**, also called `App ID`, will be used when you initialize the SDK.
- **Client Token**, also called `App Key`, will be used when you initialize the SDK on the client side.
- **Server Secret**, also called `Master Key`, will be used when you interact with admin interfaces on **trusted environments** including your own server and LeanEngine. When you use it, all the permission checks will be skipped. Make sure to **keep it private and never use it in the code for the client**.

See [Domain](#domain) for setting up the domain.
